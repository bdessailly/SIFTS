SIFTS

The SIFTS module is a Perl interface to the SIFTS mapping of PDB to 
UniProt residues. The SIFTS mapping is maintained at the EBI. For 
more information on the mapping itself, please refer to 
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts/.

This module is designed for *nix systems exclusively. I have written 
a number of basic tests, but more is always best when it comes to 
tests. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more 
information or if you wish to contribute to this project.
